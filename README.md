# VSoC-24

Project Overview:
The project involves creating a voice-controlled assistant named J.A.R.V.I.S, capable of executing tasks based on user commands. It utilizes speech recognition for input, integrates APIs for data retrieval (e.g., weather information), and provides audio feedback using synthesized speech. The assistant interacts with users through visual elements and performs actions like opening websites and playing music.

Current Issue:
We're facing difficulty fetching commands from a Process.json file located in the /mic/ directory. This file is crucial for interpreting user requests correctly. Possible issues include incorrect file path referencing or server-related challenges, affecting the assistant's ability to respond accurately to commands.

Next Steps:
To resolve the issue, we'll verify the file path (/mic/Process.json) used in the fetch request, validate the JSON content for correct formatting, and implement robust error handling. Testing strategies will be refined to ensure seamless command execution, despite challenges such as limited access to a microphone for real-time testing.

Objective:
By addressing these technical challenges systematically, we aim to enhance the assistant's reliability and user experience, ensuring smooth interaction and accurate task execution based on spoken commands.
